                            Biophilia is the idea that humans possess an innate
                            tendency to seek connections with nature.
                        </strong>
                        The term translates to ‘the love of living things’ in ancient
                        Greek (philia = the love of / inclination towards), and was
                        used by German-born American psychoanalyst Erich Fromm in The
                        Anatomy of Human Destructiveness (1973), which described
                        biophilia as “the passionate love of life and of all that is
                        alive.” The term was later used by American biologist Edward
                        O. Wilson in his work Biophilia (1984), which proposed that
                        the tendency of humans to focus on and to affiliate with

                    <h4>Design in Details</h4>
                    <p>
                        In design, we bring characteristics of the natural world into
                        built spaces, such as water, greenery, and natural light, or
                        elements like wood and stone. Encouraging the use of natural
                        systems and processes in design allows for exposure to nature,
                        and in turn, these design approaches improve health and
                        wellbeing. There are a number of possible benefits, including
                        reduced heart rate variability and pulse rates, decreased
                        blood pressure, and increased activity in our nervous systems,
                        to name a few.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, our connections to the natural world diverged in
                        parallel with technological developments. Advances in the 19th
                        and 20th centuries fundamentally changed how people interact
                        with nature. Sheltered from the elements, we spent more and
                        more time indoors. Today, the majority of people spend almost
                        80-90% of their time indoors, moving between their homes and
                        workplaces. As interior designers embrace biophilia.
